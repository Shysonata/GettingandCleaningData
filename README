Code_Book.Rmd a code book that describes the datasets, and the resulting tidied datasets following the use of the script "run_analysis.R".
It also explains the names assigned to renamed variables.

Outcomes of the "run_analysis.R" script:
-Loads and merges the training and test datasets into a single unified file (samsung_data).
-Tidies the dataset, by adding descriptive names to activities, and appropriately labelling variable names: (tidy_data).
-Computes the means and standard deviations for each measurement in the dataset (final_data).
-Explorts the data to a text file named "final_data.txt".
